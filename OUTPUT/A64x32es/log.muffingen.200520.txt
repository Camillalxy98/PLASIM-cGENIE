   Hello! Welcome to muffingen v0.87
   We are going to make a GREAT model configuration!

>   1. CHECKING PRIMARY OPTIONS ...
       * GENIE grid will be loaded directly from k1, mask, or k2 text file: epcs6432
>   2. CREATING GENIE GRID ...
       - GENIE grid generated.
>   3. READING AXES INFORMATION ...
         (Nothing to load.)
>   4. READING MASK & TOPO GRIDS ...
       - k1 read.
       - GENIE grid re-generated.
>   5. RE-GRIDING MASK ...
         (Nothing to do ... k1/mask/k2 file already loaded.)
>   6. FILTERING MASK ...
       * found 1 water masses
       - Small water bodies cleaned up.
       * Revised land area fraction = 0.15283
>   7. USER EDITING OF MASK ...
       * Mask alteration procedure :
         (1) left button to turn grid cell to ocean
         (2) right button to turn grid cell to land
         (3) middle button, or clickoutside the grid, to finish
         -> Cell at (21, 26) now ocean
         -> Cell at (19, 26) now ocean
         -> Cell at (19, 27) now ocean
       - Out of grid range
       * Mask alteration complete
       * Revised land area fraction = 0.15137
       - User-editing complete.
>   8. CREATE FINAL MASK ...
       - .mask_out.FINAL.dat saved
       * Final land area fraction   = 0.15137
>   9. RE-GRIDING TOPOGRAPHY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid -- convert k1 file data.)
>   10. RE-GRIDING OCEAN BATHYMETRY ...
         (Nothing to re-grid as k1 file already loaded.)
